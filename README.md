# PDFMerger
This is a simple PyQt5 based PDF Merger. I wanted to create a small Desktop App for merging and splitting PDF since i didn't want to upload my personal data to some shady website.

## Getting Started

Its a Program written in Python 3.7+, Libraries used: -PyQt5 -PyPDF2. The IDE used is PyCharm. Just copy and paste each source code to some IDE into a Python Project and run the main.py file.
